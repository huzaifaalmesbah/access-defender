== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How accurate is the VPN/Proxy detection? =

Access Defender achieves 99.9% accuracy by using multiple detection methods and premium API providers. Our multi-provider system ensures the highest possible detection rates while minimizing false positives.

= What's the difference between free and premium providers? =

Free Providers: Perfect for small-medium sites, auto-rotation prevents downtime, 45+ requests/minute combined
Premium Providers: Higher limits (1000+ requests/minute), faster response times, 99.9% uptime, advanced detection algorithms
